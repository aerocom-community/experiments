Managing [AeroCom](https://aerocom.met.no) experiments and associated diagnostics.

## Discussion
Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/aerocom-community/experiments/discussions) forum to discuss ideas you might have for experiments, diagnostics or anything else relevant to AeroCom experiments. 

## For uploading a new experiment:
1. Click "Add file" and "+ Create new file"
  <img width="864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd0d7f4f-3b17-4a89-81d2-a30141b48dcc">

2. Write in the path (from the root) and name of your file:

3. Write in your description in markdown. It's a very simple symtax (much simpler than Latex!), and you can find some introductory instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). If you already wrote it in another format, chatgpt is very good at converting, even tables, to markdown: Just copy paste and ask for markdown format.
