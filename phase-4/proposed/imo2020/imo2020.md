## Motivation:

Can we use the aerosol radiative forcing from the IMO 2020 shipping regulations, which is in theory observable, as an emergent constraint for historical aerosol effective radiative forcing overall?

Starting in January 2020, the global limit on the sulfur mass content of marine fuels decreased from 3.5% to 0.5%; the actual decrease, however, was probably closer to an 80% reduction because the average marine fuel sold at market pre-2020 had a sulfur content of 2.5% (Diamond, 2023). A decline in detectible ship tracks was observed almost immediately (Watson-Parris et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2022) and, unlike those observed during regional implementations of stricter emissions regulations (Gryspeerdt et al., 2019), were global in nature with no systematic compensation outside the major pre-existing shipping routes. A reduction in shipping-induced cloud microphysical perturbations have also been observed in individual tracks (Manshausen et al., 2023) and within a shipping corridor (Diamond, 2023). A hybrid model-observations analysis has estimated the global forcing from the IMO 2020 regulations as 0.14 W m-2 (Yuan et al., 2024) while global climate model forcings range from ~0.05 to 0.15 W m-2 (Gettelman et al. , 2024; Jordan & Henry, 2024; Quaglia & Visioni, 2024; Skeie et al., 2024; Yoshioka et al., 2024). Both internal variability and structural differences amongst the models appear to affect the results, as well as differences in boundary conditions (e.g., 80 versus 85% reductions in fuel sulfur and choices around nudging to meteorology). 

Figure 1 below illustrates the range of current model estimates, along with their historical aerosol effective radiative forcing estimates from Smith et al. (2021). There is at least a hint of a relationship between the forcing produced for IMO 2020 conditions and the total historical aerosol forcing. In this experiment, we propose testing whether the IMO 2020 perturbation can help constrain historical aerosol forcing (as quantified by the aci-baseline experiment) when simulated under a common protocol.

## Objectives:
- Test how well modeled IMO 2020 cloud changes/forcings correlate with historical aerosol forcing from all sources
- Test how well global IMO 2020 cloud changes/forcing correlates with regional forcing (specifically, SE Atlantic)
- Calculate observational constraints on historical aerosol forcing from observed global and/or regional cloud changes/forcings after IMO 2020 went into effect
- [If needed] Constrain global IMO 2020 forcing from regional cloud changes/forcings
---

## Proposed Model Experiments:

Tier 1: Control (2019 meteorology and 2015 CEDS emissions) and IMO2020 (80% reduction in shipping $\mathrm{SO}_2$)

Tier 2: IMO2020-SEA (80% reduction in shipping $\mathrm{SO}_2$ in SE Atlantic shipping corridor only)

### General Simulation Requirements:
- **Simulation Period:** Year 2017
- **Nudging:** Yes, to ERA5 meteorology (temperature and winds) for year 2017
- **SST:** NOAAGlobalTemp
- **Repetitions:** At least 5 years of repeated nudged meteorology/SST/emission conditions to constain snyoptic variability but maintain uncertainty due to different cloud evolutions

## Diagnostics ##

 *   Data in NetCDF format, one variable and year per file with CMOR variable names
 *   All data are 3-dimensional, e.g., ``( lon x lat x time )``; if your model
     uses other than a lon-lat coordinate system, please provide the data in
     your model's native format (no post-processing remapping)
 *   Filename format is ``aerocom_<ModelName>_<ExperimentName>_<VariableName>_<VerticalCoordinateType>_<Period>_<Frequency>.nc``,\
    where ``<ModelName>`` can be chosen such that model name, model version and possibly the institution can be identified. No underscores (``_``) are allowed in ``<ModelName>``. Use (-) instead. Max 20 characters. \
    ``<ExperimentName>`` = ``CTRL``, ``20shp``, ``20shp-SEA``\
    ``<VariableName>`` see list below \
    ``<VerticalCoordinateType>`` => "Surface", "TOA", "Column", "ModelLevel" \
    ``<Period>`` => "2017" \
    ``<Frequency>`` => "timeinvariant","hourly", ,"3hourly", "daily", "monthly" 
 *  CFMIP COSP diagnostics provided by COSP do not need to be run through cmor because the names are the same, 
      but please separate files for each variable

<!-- In addition to the diagnostics below, it is highly recommended to store the AEROCOM standard and forcing diagnostics, so that the simulations can be analysed for the direct forcing as well, and future more in-depth analyses are possible.  -->

## Model Output Submission:
Submit your model output via the AeroCom website: [Submit Data](https://aerocom.met.no/FAQ/data_access/submit_data).

### Model Output Naming Convention:
The format for the AeroCom file name (one variable per file) should be:

`aerocom4_<ModelName>_<YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME>-<SimulationName>_<VariableName>_<VerticalCoordinateType>_<Year>_monthly.nc`

#### Example Filenames:
- `aerocom4_GEOS-i33p2_imo2020-CTRL_od550aer_Column_2017_monthly.nc`

## Sampling of cloud-top quantities ## 

The idea is to use the cloud overlap assumption (maximum, random, or
maximum-random) to estimate which part of the cloud in a layer can be seen from
above.

Note: For the CCN, whether to sample it in the same way as CDNC, or use a similar approach (going from bottom up)    
to sample it at cloud base depends on your parameterization of the activation.

let $i=1,2,...,nx$ be the index for the horizontal grid-points \
let $k=1,2,...,nz$ be the index for the vertial levels, with 1 being the uppermost level, and nz the surface level 

### "Cloud-top" calculation ### 
This piece of Fortran code was used to calculate the Phase 2 Indirect3 ACI diagnostics.
We suggest using it again for the Phase 4 ACI baseline experiment.  Models that
participated in Phase 2 Indirect3 probably already have an implementation of
this that can be reused. 

``` fortran
thres_cld = 0.001  
thres_cod = 0.3  
IF ( iovl = random OR iovl = maximum-random ) THEN
  clt(i) = 1.
ELSE
  clt(:) = 0
ENDIF  
icc(:) = 0  
lcc(:) = 0  
ttop(:) = 0  
cdr(:) = 0  
icr(:) = 0  
cdnc(:) = 0


DO i=1,nx
	DO k=2,nz ! assumption: uppermost layer is cloud-free (k=1)
		IF ( cod3d(i,k) > thres_cod and f3d(i,k) > thres_cld ) THEN ! visible, not-too-small cloud
			! flag_max is needed since the vertical integration for maximum overlap is different from the two others: for maximum, clt is the actual cloud cover in the level, for the two others, the actual cloud cover is 1 - clt
			! ftmp is total cloud cover seen from above down to the current level
			! clt is ftmp from the level just above
			! ftmp - clt is thus the additional cloud fraction seen from above in this level

			IF ( iovl = maximum ) THEN
				flag_max = -1.
				ftmp(i) = MAX( clt(i), f3d(i,k))  ! maximum overlap	
			ELSEIF ( iovl = random ) THEN
				flag_max = 1.
				ftmp(i) = clt(i) * ( 1 - f3d(i,k) ) ! random overlap	
			ELSEIF ( iovl = maximum-random ) THEN
				flag_max = 1.
				ftmp(i) = clt(i) * ( 1 - MAX( f3d(i,k), f3d(i,k-1) ) ) / &
   	            ( 1 - MIN( f3d(i,k-1), 1 - thres_cld ) )  ! maximum-random overlap	
			ENDIF
			ttop(i) = ttop(i) + t3d(i,k) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 

			! ice clouds
			icr(i) = icr(i) + icr3d(i,k) * ( 1 - phase3d(i,k) ) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 
			icc(i) = icc(i) + ( 1 - phase3d(i,k) ) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 
	
			! liquid water clouds
			cdr(i) = cdr(i) + cdr3d(i,j) * phase3d(i,k) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 
			cdnc(i) = cdnc(i) + cdnc3d(i,j) * phase3d(i,k) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 
			lcc(i) = lcc(i) + phase3d(i,k) * ( clt(i) - ftmp(i) )*flag_max 
			
			clt(i) = ftmp(i)
		ENDIF ! is there a visible, not-too-small cloud?
	ENDDO ! loop over k

	IF ( iovl = random OR iovl = maximum-random ) THEN
		clt(i) = 1. - clt(i)
	ENDIF
ENDDO ! loop over I
```
