## Preliminary remarks ##

This document is a **draft** meant to structure discussion at the Lille
workshop.  **We are actively soliciting comments.**  You can provide comments in
any of the following ways:
 
 1. Contact Johannes Mülmenstädt by email (<johannes.muelmenstaedt@pnnl.gov>)
 1. Leave a comment or edit the [google docs version of this
    document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlV4SynIRs0v6d8X2GwikCh9I8D_XKCw/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111193538246169007999&rtpof=true&sd=true) _in suggestion mode_
 1. Interact directly with the [master version of this document on
    GitHub](https://github.com/aerocom-community/experiments/blob/main/phase-4/proposed/aci-baseline/aci-baseline.md) (e.g., via a
    pull request containing your proposed changes)
	
Johannes Mü will collate comments and suggestions, and they will be discussed at the Lille
workshop. 

## Data submission deadline ##

**TBD at Lille workshop** 

## Simulation setup ##

* Five years nudged to winds (not temperature or humidity)
* Preferred: Nudge toward ECMWF reanalysis winds 
* Acceptable: Nudge toward winds from one baseline simulation by your model 
* Simulation start year **TBD** to weigh the trade-off between satellite
availability, recent features in the temperature and forcing time series, etc.
Will include the overall Phase 4 baseline year.
* all_2000: simulation PD (present-day): year 2000 IPCC aerosol emissions 
* all_1850: simulation PI (preindustrial): year 1850 IPCC aerosol emissions (year 2000 GHG concentration, nudged to present-day winds)
<!-- *   Forcing by AMIP2 sea surface temperature and sea-ice extent  
 *   Greenhouse gas concentrations for year 2000  -->

<!-- [comment]: # these sound like beyond-the-baseline -->
<!-- [comment]: #  *   hom_2000: present day emissions no heterogeneous nucleation of ice in cirrus clouds with T%%<%%-37 C -->
<!-- [comment]: #  *   hom_1850: as in hom_2000, but for pre-industrial emissions  -->
<!-- [comment]: #  *   fix_2000: present day emissions fixed ice nucleation for T%%<%%-37 C using a constant ice number of 383.6 /L, which is from Cooper (1986) at T=-37C  -->
<!-- [comment]: #  *   fix_1850: as in fix_2000, but for pre-industrial emissions   -->

## Motivation ##

The AeroCom Phase 4 "ACI baseline" experiment design builds on the highly
successful [Phase 2 Indirect Effect Experiment ("Indirect3")](https://wiki.met.no/aerocom/indirect), updated to address
the new science questions that have emerged since (and, in many cases, as a
result of) Indirect3.  We have aimed to retain what made Indirect3 great, moved
the technically more challenging aspects into "beyond-the-baseline" experiments
that modelers can opt into separately, and updated the output request with things we
wish had been included.

<!-- Broadly, the purpose of the experiment is to address persistent key areas of uncertainty: 1) the sensitivity of cloud liquid water path to aerosol, and 2) the competition between heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation of ice crystals.  -->

<!-- To address issue 1), we’ve added daily and monthly diagnostics that can be compared with CloudSat and MODIS retrievals of the relationship between the aerosol optical depth and the probability of precipitation (Wang et al., 2012).  -->

<!-- To address issue 2), we’ve added experiments in which heterogeneous nucleation is neglected for T%%<%%-37C, and in which ice nucleation for T%%<%%-37C is a prescribed function of temperature (Cooper, 1986). -->

<!-- We also have added a requirement to nudge toward analyzed winds, which we’ve found greatly reduces the noise due to natural variability without significantly inhibiting the cloud response to the aerosol. (Kooperman et al., 2012). Simulations of six years duration each should be sufficient for all experiments.  -->

<!-- To facilitate analysis and comparison before the 2013 AeroCom meeting, the results should be submitted to the AeroCom repository by December 1, 2013. Please contact steve.ghan@pnnl.gov and xiaohong.liu@pnnl.gov when your results have been submitted. -->

## Diagnostics ##

 *   All data is to be collected at the AeroCom server.
 *   Follow the aerocom data protocol (http://aerocom.met.no/protocol.html)
 *   Data in NetCDF format, one variable and year per file with CMOR variable names
 *   All data are 3-dimensional, e.g., ``( lon x lat x time )``; if your model
     uses other than a lon-lat coordinate system, please provide the data in
     your model's native format (no post-processing remapping)
 *   Filename format is ``aerocom_<ModelName>_<ExperimentName>_<VariableName>_<VerticalCoordinateType>_<Period>_<Frequency>.nc``,\
    where ``<ModelName>`` can be chosen such that model name, model version and possibly the institution can be identified. No underscores (``_``) are allowed in ``<ModelName>``. Use (-) instead. Max 20 characters. \
    ``<ExperimentName>`` = ``all_2000``, ``all_1850``\
    ``<VariableName>`` see list below \
    ``<VerticalCoordinateType>`` => "Surface", "TOA", "Column", "ModelLevel" \
    ``<Period>`` => "2008", "2010", ... (note at this point *period TBD*) \
    ``<Frequency>`` => "timeinvariant","hourly", ,"3hourly", "daily", "monthly" 
 *  CFMIP COSP diagnostics provided by COSP do not need to be run through cmor because the names are the same, 
      but please separate files for each variable

<!-- In addition to the diagnostics below, it is highly recommended to store the AEROCOM standard and forcing diagnostics, so that the simulations can be analysed for the direct forcing as well, and future more in-depth analyses are possible.  -->

## Sampling of cloud-top quantities ## 

The idea is to use the cloud overlap assumption (maximum, random, or
maximum-random) to estimate which part of the cloud in a layer can be seen from
above.

Note: For the CCN, whether to sample it in the same way as CDNC, or use a similar approach (going from bottom up)    
to sample it at cloud base depends on your parameterization of the activation.

let $i=1,2,...,nx$ be the index for the horizontal grid-points \
let $k=1,2,...,nz$ be the index for the vertial levels, with 1 being the uppermost level, and nz the surface level 

### Naming convention for the 3D input fields: ### 

iovl is the flag to select the overlap hypothesis\
cod3d(nx,nz) cloud optical thickness\
f3d(nx,nz) cloud fraction\
t3d(nx,nz) temperature\
phase3d(nx,nz) cloud thermodynamic phase (0: entire cloud consists of ice, 
1: entire cloud consists of liquid water, between 0 and 1: mixed-phase)\
phase3d could be from fice3d/f3d where fice3d=ice+mixed phase cloud fraction\
cdr3d(nx,nz) in-cloud  droplet effective radius\
icr3d(nx,nz) in-cloud ice crystal effective radius\
cdnc3d(nx,nz) in-cloud droplet number concentration\ 

### "Cloud-top" calculation ### 
This piece of Fortran code was used to calculate the Phase 2 Indirect3 ACI diagnostics.
We suggest using it again for the Phase 4 ACI baseline experiment.  Models that
participated in Phase 2 Indirect3 probably already have an implementation of
this that can be reused.

			! flag_max is needed since the vertical integration for maximum overlap is different from the two others: for maximum, clt is the actual cloud cover in the level, for the two others, the actual cloud cover is 1 - clt
			! ftmp is total cloud cover seen from above down to the current level
			! clt is ftmp from the level just above
			! ftmp - clt is thus the additional cloud fraction seen from above in this level

 <!-- ==== Q/A ==== -->

 <!-- *    2D cloud fields (lwp, iwp, cdr, cdnc, ttop, cod): Please save them as grid-box mean values but DO NOT divide by the total (2D) cloud cover, which will be done in analysis after averaging in time and space.  -->
         
 <!-- *    The three months 1 October - 31 December 2005  are thought as spin-up, which can of course be longer. Please choose as overlap assumption the one you use in the radiation scheme.   -->
    
 <!-- *    ATTENTION: clt(i) has to be initialized to 1 for random or maximum-random overlap assumptions in the "satellite simulator"   -->
